Plugin to mix VCL and FireMonkey forms in the same Delphi project

The intention of this plugin is to make it easy for those of us with large existing projects to gradually migrate them over to FireMonkey, while still being able to release updates of our evolving software to clients.

This is particularly ideal for those with cross-platform ambitions down the line, where otherwise the "cost" of investing in a completely new project would be prohibitive.

While Embarcadero does not officially endorse this method, those who're using it have made it abundantly clear that, as of Delphi XE7 update 1 at least, the method "just works".

Please be aware that there's a possibility that future versions of Delphi may break this functionality.
